# Automotive-Cybersecurity-Projects


This repository contains a collection of practical, hands-on automotive cybersecurity projects developed to demonstrate skills across vehicle networking, diagnostics, threat modelling, embedded security, and automotive communication protocols.

These projects showcase real-world cybersecurity techniques used in modern vehicles and are highly relevant to roles in:

* Automotive Cybersecurity Engineering

* Embedded Security Engineering

* AUTOSAR Security

* ECU Development

* Cyber-Physical Systems

* Automotive R&D

Each project is self-contained and includes documentation, code, and example outputs.

📁 Projects Included
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. UDS Security Access Tool

A Python implementation of UDS diagnostic routines, including the 0x27 Security Access challenge–response mechanism. Shows understanding of ECU security, diagnostics, and brute-force protection techniques.

Folder: uds-security-access/

 2. CAN Bus Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A lightweight IDS that analyses CAN traffic logs and detects anomalies using statistical methods and simple ML-based techniques. Demonstrates vehicle network security fundamentals.

Folder: can-bus-ids/

 3. DoIP ECU Discovery Tool

A simple Diagnostics over IP (DoIP) scanner for discovering ECUs over automotive Ethernet and parsing diagnostic headers. Shows experience with modern automotive communication protocols.

Folder: doip-scanner/

 4. SOME/IP Fuzzing Tool

A Python-based fuzzer for SOME/IP, targeting service discovery and message structures. Useful for demonstrating automotive network security assessment techniques.

Folder: someip-fuzzer/

 5. ISO 21434 TARA Example

A complete cybersecurity Threat Analysis & Risk Assessment (TARA) using the HEAVENS 2.0 methodology. Shows familiarity with cybersecurity processes and automotive standards.

Folder: iso21434-tara/
